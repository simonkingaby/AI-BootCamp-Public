**<a id="replicate_note">Note on using Replicate</a>**
To run some of the demo apps here, you'll need to first sign in with Replicate with your github account, then create a free API token [here](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens) that you can use for a while. After the free trial ends, you'll need to enter billing info to continue to use Llama2 hosted on Replicate - according to Replicate's [Run time and cost](https://replicate.com/meta/llama-2-13b-chat) for the Llama2-13b-chat model used in our demo apps, the model "costs $0.000725 per second. Predictions typically complete within 10 seconds." This means each call to the Llama2-13b-chat model costs less than $0.01 if the call completes within 10 seconds. If you want absolutely no costs, you can refer to the section "Running Llama2 locally on Mac" above or the "Running Llama2 in Google Colab" below.

**<a id="octoai_note">Note on using OctoAI</a>**
You can also use [OctoAI](https://octo.ai/) to run some of the Llama demos under [OctoAI_API_examples](./llama_api_providers/OctoAI_API_examples/). You can sign into OctoAI with your Google or GitHub account, which will give you $10 of free credits you can use for a month. Llama2 on OctoAI is priced at [$0.00086 per 1k tokens](https://octo.ai/pricing/) (a ~350-word LLM response), so $10 of free credits should go a very long way (about 10,000 LLM inferences).

### [Running Llama2 in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-uBXt4L-6HNS2D8Iny2DwUpVS4Ub7jnk?usp=sharing)
To run Llama2 in Google Colab using [llama-cpp-python](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python), download the quantized Llama2-7b-chat model [here](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7b-Chat-GGUF/resolve/main/llama-2-7b-chat.Q4_0.gguf), or follow the instructions above to build it, before uploading it to your Google drive. Note that on the free Colab T4 GPU, the call to Llama could take more than 20 minutes to return; running the notebook locally on M1 MBP takes about 20 seconds.
